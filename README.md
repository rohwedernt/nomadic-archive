# 🗂️ The Nomadic Archives

Welcome to **The Nomadic Archives** — a lovingly assembled digital vault for everything we could recover from Nomadic’s past. This site is a tribute to the magic of a chaotic early-2010s music project: part time capsule, part shrine, and part internet archaeology.

You'll find show flyers, grainy videos, unreleased live recordings, band photos, and whatever else we could scrounge up from dusty hard drives, abandoned accounts, and long-lost links. Think of it as a **rescue mission for digital ephemera**, with a healthy sense of humor about the format.

This site is built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and powered by the [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli) CLI.
