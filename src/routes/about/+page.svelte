		<p class="pb-2 text-sm">
			<b>Welcome to the Nomadic Archives</b> â€” a dusty digital attic packed with photos, videos, poorly recorded live sets, show-poster masterpieces, and whatever other fragments we thought had been lost to the void.
		</p>
		<p class="pb-2 text-sm">
			Nomadic lived during the magical, chaotic blur known as the early 2010s. Over time, the media trail we left behind scattered across the internet like birdshot â€” Facebook posts, Instagram accounts we can't log into, maybe a rogue Myspace link, definitely a ReverbNation page (â€¦is that still a thing?), and a Dropbox folder that hasn't been cracked open since the Obama years.
		</p>
		<p class="text-sm">
			This site is our attempt to gather all that chaos into one place â€” a living, breathing Nomadic vault. A permanent, safely stored, redundantly backed-up home for all of it.
